A sample of Dynamic Island widgets that will help you make better things!

# 🏝 Dynamic Islands
This repo aims to provide sample code for lots of different types of Live Activities in the Dynamic Island, for you to use as inspiration for your own projects. We start by recreating the Islands that Apple has introduced for the launch of the iPhone 14 Pro. The goal is to make each island type customizable, accessible and flexible so that you can easily change it to your needs.
